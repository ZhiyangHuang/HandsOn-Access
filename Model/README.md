# Model Directory

This directory stores AI models and training files used by HandsOn-Access:

- **Face Recognition Models**: InsightFace models for face detection and recognition
- **Facial Gesture Models**: MediaPipe models for facial gesture detection
- **Voice Recognition Models**: Whisper and VOSK models for voice typing
- **Training Data**: User-specific training files and configurations

## Model Files

Place your trained models and model files in this directory. The application will load them at runtime.

## Note

Models are not included in the repository due to size. Download required models separately or train your own using the Initialization module.
